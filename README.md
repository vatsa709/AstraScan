# üöÄ AstraScan: Intelligent API Discovery & Misconfiguration Scanner

AstraScan is an intelligent, command-line tool designed to discover and audit API endpoints for common security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. By combining an automated endpoint fuzzer, a recursive crawler, and a powerful analysis engine, it helps you uncover hidden attack surfaces and security flaws in your APIs with a single command.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Smart Endpoint Discovery:** Probes for common API paths and then recursively crawls discovered endpoints to find a wider attack surface.  
- **API Misconfiguration Analysis:** Identifies a wide range of misconfigurations, including sensitive debug information, permissive HTTP methods, and insecure configurations.  
- **Unauthenticated Access Detection:** Automatically checks if discovered endpoints are accessible without a valid authentication token, highlighting critical authorization flaws.  
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Scans API responses for patterns that could indicate sensitive data leaks, such as email addresses, API keys, or credit card numbers.  
- **Security Header & CORS Analysis:** Audits HTTP headers like HSTS, CSP, and X-Frame-Options, and checks for dangerous CORS misconfigurations.  
- **Information Disclosure:** Identifies common information leaks in responses, such as stack traces, server banners, and internal IP addresses.  
- **Zombie API Detection:** By providing an OpenAPI/Swagger specification file, AstraScan can identify documented but unused or deprecated endpoints (Zombie APIs).  
- **GraphQL Introspection & Query Fuzzing:** Detects if GraphQL introspection is enabled and generates and tests sample queries to identify potential vulnerabilities.  
- **Parameter Fuzzing:** Injects common payloads into URL query parameters to test for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or unexpected server behavior.  
- **Inferred OpenAPI Specification:** Automatically generates a basic OpenAPI specification based on discovered endpoints, helping you document your API.  
- **CI/CD Integration:** The `--ci-mode` flag allows for easy integration into your continuous integration pipeline, failing the build if high-risk issues are found.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get started with AstraScan, follow these simple steps.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vatsa709/AstraScan.git
cd AstraScan
````

### 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# For Linux / macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

You'll need the `httpx` and `click` libraries.
Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project's root directory and add the following:

```
httpx
click
jinja2
```

Then, install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîç Usage

The scanner is controlled via the command line with various options to customize your scan.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Basic Scan

The most basic scan requires only the target URL:

```bash
python main.py --url https://api.example.com
```

### üîë Scan with Authentication

If your API requires authentication, you can provide an authorization token:

```bash
python main.py --url https://api.example.com --token "Bearer your-token-here"
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Run All Advanced Features

Use the `--all` flag to enable all available advanced scanning features in one go:

```bash
python main.py --url https://api.example.com --all -o reports/full_report.html
```

## üìä Understanding the Report

AstraScan generates a detailed **HTML report** by default, which is saved in the `reports/` directory.

The report provides:

* A comprehensive summary of the scan.
* Tables for each finding type (Misconfigurations, Sensitive Data, CORS, etc.).
* Detailed information on each issue, including affected URL, method, and reason.
* An inferred OpenAPI specification of the discovered endpoints.
* Actionable recommendations to help you fix the identified vulnerabilities.
